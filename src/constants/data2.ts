At NUYU in Cheltenham, we recommend attending follow-up appointments every 2 to 4 weeks to fine-tune the alignment and keep your treatment on track.<br/><br/>

        "The dentist will use a high quality dental lab to manufacture a bespoke set of whitening trays for you. These are filled with the whitening gel and then placed on your teeth. It is imperative that these trays are made correctly and the fit is spot on. Otherwise, the whitening process and end result will be affected.",
    },
    {
      question: "I’ve sensitive teeth, can I have still have the treatment?",
      answer:
        "Whitening can cause heightened sensitivity of teeth during the procedure. This normally subsides again once you stop whitening. Therefore if your teeth are already sensitive, you should expect this to intensify while you whiten your teeth. We can discuss techniques to reduce sensitivity at your consultation and help reduce this.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do my teeth stay white?",
      answer:
        "This depends largely on your diet and oral hygiene. Some patients go years without whitening again. Others like to ‘top up’ their whitening more regularly. It is really a personal choice. As long as your trays still fit well, you can simply buy more whitening gel from us as needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get a whiter smile?",
      answer:
        "Once you start whitening, you can start to notice the difference within days. We normally advise whitening for at least 2 weeks (from as little as 2 hours per day).",

        "I've been wearing dentures for a while - why don't they fit as comfortably as before?",

        "This is something that can happen over time, normally as a result of the lower half of your face changing shape as the jawbone starts to deteriorate. If your dentures don’t seem as comfortable or secure as before, let us know. You may need a procedure called a reline to improve their fit.",

        "In order to get dental veneers, you need to have some of the natural enamel covering your teeth removed. This is to help them fit properly. Unfortunately, enamel doesn’t regenerate. This means that any teeth that have had veneers fitted will always require veneers.",

      question: "Can I have my veneers whitened?",

        "Veneers don’t respond to whitening gel. If you are considering teeth whitening, perhaps as part of a wider smile makeover, we strongly recommend that you have your natural teeth whitened before getting veneers. This way, your veneers can be matched to your newly whitened teeth for the most effective smile transformation.",

Modern composite fillings are designed to blend seamlessly with natural teeth, ensuring a discreet and aesthetically pleasing result.<br/><br/>The procedure is quick, minimally invasive, and typically completed in a single visit, providing immediate relief and long-lasting protection. By addressing cavities early with a filling, patients can avoid more complex treatments such as root canals or extractions.

Dermaplaning is completely pain-free with no downtime, making it a popular choice for patients seeking a quick yet luxurious boost before an event or as part of regular skin maintenance. It’s suitable for most skin types and can be combined with other treatments such as facials or peels for even greater results. Our experienced skin therapists carry out every dermaplaning session with precision and care, ensuring your skin looks and feels silky-smooth, bright and beautifully refined.",

  accordion: [
    {
      question:
        "What’s the difference between a medical-grade facial and a regular facial?",
      answer:
        "Medical-grade facials use advanced, clinical-grade products and techniques to treat specific skin concerns, such as pigmentation, breakouts or dullness. They’re results-driven while still offering a relaxing, luxurious experience.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I have a medical-grade facial?",
      answer:
        "We usually recommend a facial every 4-6 weeks, depending on your skin goals. Regular treatments help maintain skin health, clarity and hydration.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is microneedling painful?",
      answer:
        "Microneedling is well-tolerated by most patients. A topical numbing cream is applied beforehand to minimise discomfort, making the treatment comfortable and effective.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long before I see results from microneedling?",
      answer:
        "You may notice a healthy glow within a few days, but full results - including improved texture and collagen production - develop gradually over several weeks. A course of treatments often gives the best outcome.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I peel after a chemical peel?",
      answer:
        "You may experience light flaking or shedding for a few days, especially after medium-strength peels. However, not all peels result in visible peeling - this depends on the type and depth of the treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can chemical peels help with pigmentation or acne?",
      answer:
        "Yes - chemical peels are highly effective for improving uneven skin tone, reducing breakouts and smoothing acne scars. We’ll select the right peel for your specific skin concerns.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will dermaplaning make my facial hair grow back thicker?",
      answer:
        "No - dermaplaning only removes fine, vellus hair (peach fuzz), which will grow back at the same rate and texture. It’s a gentle, safe way to achieve smooth, glowing skin.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often can I have dermaplaning?",
      answer:
        "Most patients benefit from treatment every 4-6 weeks, depending on their skin type and desired results. It’s also a wonderful pre-event glow-up treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I combine these treatments?",
      answer:
        "Yes - many of our treatments complement one another beautifully. For example, dermaplaning can enhance the effects of a peel or facial. We’ll guide you through safe, effective combinations for your skin.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there downtime with any of these treatments?",
      answer:
        "Most treatments have little to no downtime. You may experience mild redness or sensitivity, particularly after microneedling or peels, but this usually settles quickly. We’ll provide full aftercare advice for comfort and optimal results.",

      question: "Is it safe to get dental treatment during pregnancy?",

        "Yes, routine check-ups and preventive care are safe during pregnancy. Most dentists can carry out cleanings and minor treatments, but elective cosmetic procedures are usually postponed until after delivery.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can I continue orthodontic treatment if I need to move temporarily?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Many orthodontists provide guidance for travel or temporary relocation. Your dentist can supply the necessary tools and instructions to maintain braces or Invisalign® aligners while you’re away.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How should I manage a dental abscess before seeing a dentist?",
      answer:
        "Rinse your mouth with warm salt water, keep up with oral hygiene, and use over-the-counter pain relief if needed. Avoid squeezing or attempting to drain it yourself and book urgent treatment promptly.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Is it safe to take painkillers before a dental appointment?",
      answer:
        "Yes, over-the-counter painkillers can help ease discomfort. Always follow the dosage instructions and inform your dentist, particularly if you have any allergies or pre-existing medical conditions.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How can I prevent dental problems during long trips?",
      answer:
        "Keep up regular brushing and flossing, carry a travel dental kit, limit sugary snacks, and drink plenty of water. It’s also wise to have a check-up before you travel.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if my child’s tooth gets knocked out during sports?",
      answer:
        "Rinse the tooth gently and place it back in the socket or store it in milk. Contact a dentist immediately, as prompt attention increases the chances of saving the tooth.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Are there special considerations for dental implants if I have diabetes or heart conditions?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "How can I manage dental anxiety before a cosmetic procedure?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "Can teeth bonding fix minor chips or gaps without affecting existing teeth?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "How can I help prevent my child’s teeth from becoming misaligned?",
      answer:
        "Encourage early orthodontic check-ups, discourage thumb-sucking, and maintain good oral hygiene. Early detection makes corrective treatments simpler and often quicker.",
